# BFS Pathfinding

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding in a grid.

## Overview

The BFS algorithm is a fundamental search algorithm that explores nodes level by level. This implementation uses BFS to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point in a grid with obstacles.

## Features

- **Grid Initialization**: Randomly generates a grid with obstacles.
- **Pathfinding**: Uses BFS to find the shortest path.
- **Visualization**: Plots the grid with the path, start, goal, and explored cells
